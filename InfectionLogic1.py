                    halfOdds = (0.8*nthInfDist*(nthInfStrength/100)) + 0.1*nthInfDist # halfOdds defines the distance from the player that nth player needs to be to have a 50% chance of becoming infected by them.  This feeds into the Sigmoid curve.  
                    k = ((np.square((nthInfStrength/100)-0.5)/1.25) + 0.05) * (150/nthInfDist) # Broadly speaking, k controls the gradiant on the centre of the Sigmoid curve.  k = 0 makes the line horizontal, while k > infinite makes it vertical.  For the purpose of this program, we want k = 0.05 when nInfStrength = 0.5, and k = 0.25 when nthInfStrength = 0 or 1, hence this parabolic formula.  
                    infOdds = 100 / (1 + np.exp(k*(dist-halfOdds))) # This is the equation of a Sigmoid curve that has a Y-axis range of 0 to 100, and an X-axis range of 0 to nthInfDist.  At dist = 0 the odds of infection are always 100%, at dist = nthInfDist the odds are always 0%, and between this the odds curve smoothly with the dist value required for a 50% chance of being infected being proportional by nthInfStrength.  Higher nthInfStrength, greater dist value needed for 50%, and vis versa.  I got in at 9:30 am today.  It took me until 4:10pm to finalise and tune this solution.  I am not a mathematician.

                    if infOdds > infOddsCheck: #... And compare it to the infOdds that we calculated earlier.  If the player and nth player are very close, infOdds with trend towards towards 100, which means infOddsCheck will be more likely to be lower, which means the player is more likely to be infected.  Vis versa applies.
