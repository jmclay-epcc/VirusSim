The reason this isn't just a constant value is because we want it to vary for different infection distances and strengths, in order to get consistent curves.

At dist = 0 the odds of infection are always 100%, at dist = nthInfDist the odds are always 0%, and between this the odds curve smoothly with the dist value required for a 50% chance of being infected being proportional by nthInfStrength.  Higher nthInfStrength, greater dist value needed for 50%, and vis versa.  I got in at 9:30 am today.  It took me until 4:10pm to finalise and tune this solution.  I am not a mathematician.

If the player and nth player are very close, infOdds with trend towards towards 100, which means infOddsCheck will be more likely to be lower, which means the player is more likely to be infected.  Vis versa applies.

We also want to copy over the virus characteristics from the player that we were infected by.  This way, when we go on to infected some other player, we pass on the same viral "strain".
