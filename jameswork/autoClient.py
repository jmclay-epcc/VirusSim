As a result, if the player is cured and then is made a patient-zero by the GM, they retain the name of the virus that they were infected by rather than the name the player entered.

# Footnote
# -------------
# When trying to draw a square on a co-ordiante grid, we have two (maybe three) pieces of information to go off of: the squares side 
# length, the angle we're looking at it from, and the fact that it is indeed a square.  I, being bad at maths, approached this naively - If we approximate the square by drawing points at a distance sidelength/2 (or playerRadii), 
# (e.g. drawing a circle) then we know that this will be exactly correct at four points (the points that lie exactly on the X and Y axis), will be massively wrong at 4 more points (the points where X and Y have the 
# same absolute value), and sort of iffy in between.  So, i thought, we can fix this by having the distance we plot the points at be variable, in order to "pin" them at correct values given the angle that we're looking at the square from.  
# Wed want this extra term vary with the angle so that it doesn't add anything when the circle approximate is correct (e.g. at angles 0, 90, 180 and 270), ands a lot when its very incorrect (45, 135, 225, and 315), and 
# then add whatever is appropriate in between these values.  So i did that - i added a sin term to the distance (thus giving us the variable truePlayerRadii), and found that while it was now exactly correct at 8 points, 
# it still had considerable error everywhere else.   "No matter", i thought to myself, "i'll just add another sin term that pins the values where its still wrong".  But then the obvious struck me and i realised that i was essentially 
# chasing a fourier series, something that would only actually be accurate if it had INFINITE terms.  I could add as many terms as i wanted, and while it would narrow in on something functional without 3 or 4, it would never be perfect, 
# and the effort to chase that point would be disproportionate.  
# 
# So how to fix this without going that a fourier transform rabbit hole?  Well, the shape that truePlayerRadii gives us when we plot is is sort of like a lumpy square - its up, down, left, right and diagonal points are correct, but every
# other point is too far away.  It is unexpectable for any point to lie significantly further out from the centre of the player than its true size, because that can result in the pathfinding logic peaking through walls further down the line.  
# So instead, we add a scaling factor to draw each point slightly closer in than it otherwise would be.  This makes it so that the furthest out point of the "lumps" are roughly the right distance away from the centre of the shape, and the points 
# that were previously exactly correct are a little bit closer in.  This isn't ideal, but it significantly better than approximating the player as a circle, or overestimating its physical size.  

# Ok i've finally realised a misassumption i've been making.  I have been splitting the childTPs that i find into two sets - set a with the nearest childTPs, and set b with the second nearest childTPs - and have been operating under the 
# mistaken thought that each set are all on the same side.  I've been imagining that these points are found by first looking up the line in the position y direction, and then in the negative y direction, and thus all of set a is in the positive y
# and all of set b is in the negative.  This is obviously, obviously wrong.  The sets are filled, OBVIOUSLY, nearest in a and second nearest in b.  Whether or not the nearest in in the positive or negative y is immaterial.  Since i've been labouring
# under this bizarre misinterpretation of my own work, i've essentially been shooting myself in the foot over and over.  God almighty.  When you make an assumption, you make an ass out of An and Umption.  

# I have discovered another releated misassumption that i was making.  I am still a little sick so despite having finally realised this mistake, i can't articulate it very well.  
# So, the program picks an angle.  It then draws a line that follows this angle and which passes through the parentTP across the map.  It finds the first wall that the point intersects and places it in set A, and then finds the second point and places 
# it in set B.  It then offsets the parentTP in the positive direction, and repeats the process.  It then finally offsets the parentTP in the negative direction and repeats a final time.  This gives us set A, which is filled with nearest wall intersects 
# to each of the three parent point, and set B, which is filled with the second nearest points.  
# I have already established that when this is repeated for different angles, the new set A and B aren't nessesarily going to be on the same side of the Y-axis (which is to say, if the first set A is positive Y, then the second isn't nessesarily also going
# to be positive Y).  However the big oversight i made is that within each set, the nearest wall intersect of each of the 3 lines we test aren't nessesarily going to be on the same side of the Y-axis either.  If the nearest and second nearest points are 
# about the same distance apart, then the offset in the parentTPs position that it made for the latter two lines can be enough to flip the two nearest points.  The effect of this is that set A could contain two points that are on the same side of the Y-axis, 
# and one thats on the opposite side, which explains some issues that i was encountering perfectly.  I have updated the code to account for this, which has fixed the observed issues.
