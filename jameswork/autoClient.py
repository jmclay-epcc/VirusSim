As a result, if the player is cured and then is made a patient-zero by the GM, they retain the name of the virus that they were infected by rather than the name the player entered.  So, to combat this, we make a copy of the players original virus name and use it to correct the virus name when appropriate (when the player is uninfected and virus != originalVirusName, which only ever happens in the previously described scenario).

To grossly summarise the process, this script is set up such that each TP found will be seperated by an angle of 360/2*magStaffCalls, so if magStaffCalls = 1 then the TPs will be 180 degrees apart.  If magStaffCalls is even, for example 2, then there will be TPs at 90 and 270 degrees, which mean that they lie on a line with infinite gradient, which is a problem that is best just avoided outright.  11 seems to be a sweet spot.
